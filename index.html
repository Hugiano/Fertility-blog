                    <h3>What is Infertility?</h3>
                    <p> Infertility is a <b>disease</b> condition where a male or female is unable to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. <br><br> 
                    Infertility affects millions of people of reproductive age worldwide â€“ and has an impact on their families and communities. Estimates suggest that between 48 million couples and 186 million individuals live with infertility globally. <Br></Br> it is important to note that the word <i> <b>infertility</b> </i> used above is merely a description of a disease condition and not a parmanent state and just like most disease conditions, it can be treated with great success. <a href="#treatment" class="inline-link">see treatment</a> </p>

                    <h3>Causes of Infertility?</h3>

                    <p>I appologize in advance because i will be sounding a bit technical because i really want you to understand what i am saying</p> 
                    
                    <br>

                    <p>The difficulties of getting pregnant most often comes with aging and many age related challenges such as: abnormal development of oocyte (eggs); DNA damage; endometriosis etc.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>These problems/challenges arise because as we get old, our body begins to grow weak. This weakness is caused by a sudden drop in the bodies NAD+ (Nicotineamide Adenine Dinucleotide) levels. </p>
                        
                    <br>

                    <p><b>simply put, <i>"As you get old, your NAD+ levels decline and as your NAD+ levels decline, your body becomes less capable of taking care of its needs."</i></b></p> 
                    
                    <br>

                    <p>This <b style="color: red;">drop</b>  in Nicotineamide Adenine Mononucleotide levels is the big problem.           
                    </p>

                    <h3>Treatment</h3>
                    <p> Now we know that depleting NAD+ levels is responsible for abnormal development of oocyte (eggs), DNA damage and subsequently infertility.</p> <br><p> Therefore, supplementing depleting NAD+ levels will effectively improve the quality of maternally aged oocytes and
                    therefore increase the chances of fertility </p>
                    
                    <br> 
                    
                    <b>What is NAD+?</b><br> 
                    <p> NAD+ (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is an important molecule that is present in your cell and it is involved in important functions like DNA repair,  enhancing the development of eggs (oocyte), promoting fertilization of the egg by sperm, promotes healthy development of your baby, adaptive stress responses,prevents DNA damage, and promotes cell survival </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>it is safe to say that NAD+ is the building block for every biological process that takes place in the body.</p>

                    <br>
                    
                    <p>NAD+ is produced in the body from  <b>NMN (Nicotinamine Mononucleotide)</b> but unfortunately, the body does not produce enough <b>NMN</b> and that is why we get old. Therefore to increase NAD+ levels, one would need to look outside for NMN supplements.</p>

                    <h3>NMN Magic of Nature</h3>
                    <p> NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) is a physically stable natural compound in our bodies that serves as building blocks for the fomation of NAD+. In the body, NMN is converted to NAD+ mostly in the liver through a series of biological pathways. once NAD+ is produced, NAD+ travels to the cells where its effect are localised. <br><br> <b>How do i get NMN?</b> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NMN is found in minute quantities in fruits,and veggies such as avocados, broccoli, cabbage, edamame, and cucumbers, but the most potent source is through NMN suplements which are sold with the brand name <b>NMN</b>
                    </p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>
                        Our NMN supplement is produced by BF Suma, which is a reputable pharmaceutical US based company.

                    <h3>FAQ</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt> <b>is NMN safe?</b></dt> 
                        <dd>Yes! NMN is a natural cofactor in your body's cell just like the way oxygen is to your lungs. and just like in the case of oxygen where too much of oxygen is almost never an issue, so also you almost can never take too much of NMN, however it really is important to always have a balance.</dd>
                        <br>
                        <dt> <b>I am 50 years old, can i still have kids safely?</b></dt> 
                        <dd>Yes! NMN has been associated with anti aging functions, taking NMN supplements will help replenish your diminishing NAD+ levels and thereby increases your chances for safe pregnancy even at 50 years</dd>
                        <br>
                        <dt> <b>Should a pregnant woman take NMN</b></dt> 
                        <dd>Absolutely!, NMN helps improve proper development of the baby and reduces the risk of having abnormalities evne at old age. For more information, contact me on <a href="#contact" style="color: rgb(27, 27, 233);text-decoration: underline;"><i>Whatsapp</i> </a> </dd>
